0-main.c, main.h- n most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

1-main.c- Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2-largest_number.c, main.h- This program prints the largest of three integers.

3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h- This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
